        // ============================== Casting (especially numbers)

    /*

        Casting occurs when the type of a value becomes different than its original type.

        Casting will often occur when working with numbers and Java inheritance.
        We will see examples of Inheritance in Java II. Number types can cast to a larger
        number type (e.g. short to a long) or to a smaller type (e.g. long to a short).
        Going from larger number type to a smaller type is called "explicit" casting and
        requires the programmer to write extra syntax to indicate that this potentially risky
        operation is REALLY what we want to happen. Going the opposite direction is called
        "implicit" casting and does not require extra syntax.

        Helpful chart: https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_type_casting.asp

        int x = 1;
        long y = x; // implicit casting
        short z = (short) x; // explicit casting

    /*
        Use the Switch case ONLY when checking for multiple possible values for a single given variable.
        In all other cases, use regular if/else if statements.

    /*

        Use recursion when it makes your code more easily readable than using a loop.
